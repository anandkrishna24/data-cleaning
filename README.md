 ðŸš€ Task 1 - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This repository contains the complete solution for **Task 1** of the AI & ML Internship, which focuses on cleaning and preparing data for machine learning using the Titanic dataset.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To learn how to clean and preprocess raw data by performing:
- Null value treatment
- Categorical encoding
- Feature scaling
- Outlier removal
- Feature engineering

---

## âœ… Key Steps Performed

### 1. ðŸ”„ Data Exploration
- Checked for null values, data types, and descriptive statistics
- Identified columns with missing data like `Age`, `Embarked`, and `Cabin`

### 2. ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning
- Dropped `Cabin` due to excessive missing values
- Filled `Age` with median, `Embarked` with mode
- Removed duplicate entries

### 3. ðŸ”¤ Categorical Encoding
- Standardized `Sex` and `Embarked` columns (lowercased/trimmed)
- Used **One-Hot Encoding** with `drop_first=True` for `Sex` and `Embarked`

### 4. ðŸ“Š Feature Scaling
- Applied **StandardScaler** to normalize `Age` and `Fare`

### 5. ðŸ“‰ Outlier Removal
- Used **IQR method** to detect and remove outliers in `Fare`

### 6. ðŸ§  Feature Engineering
- Added `FamilySize` = `SibSp + Parch`
- Added `IsAlone` = 1 if `FamilySize == 0`, else 0

### 7. ðŸ§¾ Final Adjustments
- Dropped irrelevant columns like `Name`, `Ticket`, and `PassengerId`
- Reset the DataFrame index
